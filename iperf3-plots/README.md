Current histogram:

## Requirement

I need the throughput of each iperf3 instance in the bars of the graph. The data
is in [data_file.dat](data_file.dat). My plot code is in
[histogram.p](histogram.p). I'm using gnuplot.

I found a sample online, but I can't make out the head of tail of it. Can you
please take a look and LMK if you know how to do it?

The sample: [How to draw rowstacked histogram in gnuplot with value labels in
each
bar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72834788/how-to-draw-rowstacked-histogram-in-gnuplot-with-value-labels-in-each-bar)
